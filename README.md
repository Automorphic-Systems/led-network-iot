# led-network-iot
Architecture artifacts for the Ambient LED Network project - a supporing architecture aimed at implementing large scale ambient LED installations.  The name for this project is a placeholder until I come up with something more interesting. 

# What This Repository Contains.

- Artifacts related to network and hardware design where applicable 
- Deployment resources and scripts where applicable

# Vision.

The idea behind the LED network is to take physical, real world input and translate it to interaction with a network collection of LED systems. Rather than being a spectator to an LED installation, participants in an immersive project are explicitly a part of it just by being in its presence. Important design features include ease of connectivity, horizontal scaling, and programmability of operations.  The resulting network allows for the creation of immersive and ambient systems at scale, and allowing artists flexibility over how interactive LED systems will behave in an installation.  To do this seamless introduces a number of technical challenges that parallel the typical challenges associated with LED installations.

With the LED network, designers are able to build out large scale interactive LED systems, and with defining LED visualizations made substantially easier, the locus of the work will shift to the "front-end" i.e. working with artists to set up sensors or other feedback-generating mechanisms in their art/workpieces.  With the ability to scale the system while limiting some of the hardware issues intrinsic to LEDs, larger interactive systems can be constructed with greater stability.
